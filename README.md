# About
__Lynchbot__ is a very simple bot for Twitter that tweets a random line (time to time) from [David Lynch's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch) five films: _Mulholland Drive_, _Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me_, _Blue Velvet_, _Eraserhead_ and _The Elephant Man_.
Theoretically it can tweet anything from a text file, but the goal with this project is to tweet specifically from the `.txt` script files I uploaded.

## Requirements
In order for you to get this bot to work properly, you must do these things:

- Have a Twitter developer account
- Have Python installed in your computer.
- Have `tweepy` installed in your computer via `pip`.

## Setting up the bot
The only thing to be done in order to run this bot is to have access to the your API keys. <br/>
Then, you will paste them over their current placeholder: <br/>

```
consumer_key='YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY_HERE'
consumer_secret='YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRETE_HERE'
access_token='YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'
access_token_secret='YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_HERE'
```
<br/>

Then, run the code by opening the terminal and typing: `python bot.py`.

# Example
[This account](https://twitter.com/lynchianbot) was created with the sole intention of testing the script.
